Update composer.json

    "config": {
        "process-timeout": 1800,
        "fxp-asset":{
            "installer-paths": {
                "npm-asset-library": "vendor/npm",
                "bower-asset-library": "vendor/bower"
            }
        }
    },

    instead of


    "config": {
        "process-timeout": 1800
    },
    "extra": {
        "asset-installer-paths": {
            "npm-asset-library": "vendor/npm",
            "bower-asset-library": "vendor/bower"
        }
    },

 =========================================================================================================================================
    Update to 2.0.13 version:
    Important: Bootstrap 3.2.1 installed
    Update some core feature: validate.js...

    Uncaught TypeError: $(...).size is not a function
    - Backend metronic/assets/layouts/layout/scripts/layout.js
    - Frontend
    => Theme not compative with Jquery 3.2.1
    => Need to downgrade to 2.2.4
    it's possible you have a newer version of jQuery on production... size() was deprecated in 1.8 and removed in 3.0 - http://api.jquery.com/size/
    You are right, another old jquery-declaration was inside the asset.

    Solution:
    Keep version 2.0.12 for current backend and frontend theme => Use Ajax validator for Unique / Only Unique remove other validators for that field
    If update to 2.0.13 => Not update bower jquery => Some features: validate unique fields... => display and dissapear too fast (Jquery too low for yii core features ) (Fixed in 2.0.13)
                        => Update Bower Jquery (using method LIKE NOTE Below) => break themes (Jquery too high for themes)


    --------------------------
    UPDATE NOTE:

    Only kc finder reuire dev
    => when update yii or other plugins

        "minimum-stability": "stable",

        (delete "iutbay/yii2-kcfinder": "dev-master", in composer.json)

        then composer update

        // composer require "yiisoft/yii2:~2.0.13" --update-with-dependencies

        this will remove kcfinder and its related

    After that change to

        "minimum-stability": "dev",
        "prefer-stable": true,


        then install kcfinder again
        composer require "iutbay/yii2-kcfinder" "dev-master"

     -> Read about minimum stability here   http://webtips.krajee.com/setting-composer-minimum-stability-application/

     DO the same kartik-v/yii2-widgets

//Swiftmailer
- Old version can send mail via windows
- New version only from host



NOTE:

I would like to add the official npmjs documentation as well which describes all methods for version specificity including the ones referred to in the question -

https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html

https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#x-ranges-12x-1x-12-

~version "Approximately equivalent to version" See npm semver - Tilde Ranges & semver (7)
^version "Compatible with version" See npm semver - Caret Ranges & semver (7)
version Must match version exactly
>version Must be greater than version
>=version etc
<version
<=version
1.2.x 1.2.0, 1.2.1, etc., but not 1.3.0
http://sometarballurl (this may be the URL of a tarball which will be downloaded and installed locally
* Matches any version
latest Obtains latest release
The above list is not exhaustive. Other version specifiers include GitHub urls and GitHub user repo's, local paths and packages with specific npm tags
